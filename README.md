# TOK ELF Headers
C headers for Paper Mario: The Origami King's data types, to be used for analyzing the files with Ghidra.

For most people largely unnecessary because [TOKElfTool](https://github.com/Darxoon/TOKElfTool) and [Origami Wand](https://Darxoon/OrigamiWand)
are more user friendly and more convienent, but useful for developing these tools.
